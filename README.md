## 🛠️ What We Worked On Tonight

Tonight, we focused on refining and enhancing the **email signature** and **landing page designs** to ensure they are professional, visually appealing, and compatible across all major platforms. Here's a summary of the key updates:

1. **Email Signature**:
   - Improved the logo's visibility by increasing its size and ensuring it aligns perfectly with the contact information.
   - Aligned all signature content (logo, name, title, email, website, phone, address, and LinkedIn profile) to the left for a clean and professional look.
   - Removed the CTA button to simplify the signature and focus on essential contact details.
   - Ensured compatibility with all major email clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) using table-based layouts.

2. **Landing Page**:
   - Enhanced the layout to make it responsive and user-friendly.
   - Improved the logo section with better visibility and alignment.
   - Organized content into sections for better readability and engagement.
   - Ensured accessibility by using high-contrast colors, readable font sizes, and descriptive `alt` attributes for images.

These updates ensure that the designs are polished, professional, and ready for deployment.
