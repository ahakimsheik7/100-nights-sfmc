## 🚀 Overcoming Challenges

### **1. Recovering Deleted Files**
During the project, some images and files were mistakenly deleted. Using Git, we were able to:
- Identify the deleted files using `git status`.
- Restore the files using `git restore` and `git checkout` commands.
- Learn the importance of staging and committing changes incrementally to avoid accidental deletions.

### **2. Structuring the Folder**
To ensure a professional and scalable project structure, we reorganized the folders as follows:
- Centralized all image assets into a single `images/` folder.
- Grouped email templates into subfolders (`airline`, `healthcare`, `adventures`) based on their themes.

### **3. Learning Git Best Practices**
Through this project, we learned:
- How to use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to manage changes effectively.
- The importance of using `git pull` and `git rebase` to keep the local branch in sync with the remote branch.
- How to resolve merge conflicts and restore accidentally deleted files using `git restore` and `git checkout`.
